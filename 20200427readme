Predominant Atmospheric and Oceanic Patterns during Coastal Marine Heatwaves


Hobday, A. J., Alexander, L. V., Perkins, S. E., Smale, D. A., Straub, S. C., Oliver, E. C., et al. (2016). 
A hierarchical approach to defining marine heatwaves. Progr. Oceanogr. 141, 227–238. doi: 10.1016/j.pocean.2015.12.014
any MHW that had “breaks' below the 90th percentile threshold lasting ≤2 days followed by subsequent days above the threshold were considered as one continuous event (Hobday et al., 2016).

gaps between events of two days or less with subsequent five day or more events will be considered as a continuous event. 
For example, five anomalously warm days followed by two cool and then six anomalously warm days would be defined as an 13 day 
MHW event [5hot,2cool 244 ,6hot]. In contrast, five anomalously warm days, followed by one cool day, and
 then two more anomalously warm days would be defined as a five day event
[5hot,1cool,2hot = 5 MHW days]; as would the converse [2hot,1cool 246 ,5hot]. A sequence of five
 anomalously warm days followed by four cool days and then six anomalously warm days
[5hot,4cool ,6hot] would be defined as two MHW events, one of five days duration, and one
 of six days duration
